# Strings don't require quotes:
title: Introduction to YAML

# But you can still use them:
title-w-quotes: 'Introduction to YAML'

# Multiline strings start with |
execute: |
    npm ci
    npm build
    npm test

# The above code will translate to JSON as:
# {
#     "title": "Introduction to YAML",
#     "title-w-quotes": "Introduction to YAML",
#     "execute": "npm ci\nnpm build\nnpm test\n"
# }
